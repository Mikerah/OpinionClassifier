# OpinionClassifier

## Overview 
This is a data analysis project on New York Times articles. The purpose was to analyze and classify news and opinion articles. Initially, I wanted to build a Django site that would classify newer New York Times articles but the classifiers where trained on a single year's (2016) data and the results wouldn't have been meaningful. So, I decided recently to forego the Django site.
